<!-- 
    Public role is added by default when a login is created and Membership of the public role cannot be changed. Therefore, DO NOT list public. 
    All properties within the node must always be included. The property LogOnLocally is the only optional property.
    If you have LogOnLocally="FALSE" and AddToLocalAdministrators="TRUE" then AddToLocalAdministrators="TRUE" will take precedence
    If you have AddToLocalAdministrators="TRUE" and IsDomainAccount="FALSE" will not do anything
    You cannot have IsDomainAccount="FALSE" and LogOnLocally="TRUE" will do not do anything
    Computer cannot be assigned a SQL role.
    Use ComponentID and InstanceID to identify a computer.
    SQL Roles are comma-delimiterd string.
    When IsDomainAccount="FALSE" you must include the Password attribute. 
    If Password is blank then it will get the password from key/value store, 
    this means that the local name must equal the domain (service) account name
    
    Note: If you add windows users to this file post the VM being provisioned then ensure you run the relevant script on ALL nodes within the cluster
